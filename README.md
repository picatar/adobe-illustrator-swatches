1. **Open Adobe Illustrator** and load or create a document that includes your desired swatches.

   - **Note:** Pantone libraries are the intellectual property of Pantone and are **not included in newer versions of Adobe Creative Cloud** due to licensing changes.  
     However, they **can still be found in older versions** of Adobe Illustrator or obtained through Pantone's official products.

   - To import Pantone libraries in supported versions, go to:  
     `Swatches > Open Swatch Library > Color Books > [Choose a Pantone book]`

2. **Ensure your document is active** before running the script.

3. **Add Pantone swatches to your Swatches panel:**
   - Drag the desired colors from the open Pantone swatch library window into your document's Swatches panel.
   - Remove any non-Pantone or unwanted colors from your Swatches panel to keep the palette clean.

4. **Run the script:**
   - Go to `File > Scripts > Other Script‚Ä¶`
   - Select `generate-swatches.jsx` from this repository.

5. **Save your swatch library as an ASE file:**
   - In the Swatches panel, click the hamburger menu (top right).
   - Near the bottom of the menu, select **Save Swatch Library as ASE...**
   - Choose a folder and file name to save your custom swatch library.

6. **Load your saved ASE swatch library into any Illustrator document:**
   - Open the Swatches panel.
   - Click the hamburger menu.
   - Choose **Open Swatch Library > Other Library‚Ä¶**
   - Navigate to your saved ASE file and open it to load the swatches.

## üñ•Ô∏è Script Code

```javascript
var doc = app.activeDocument;
var swatches = doc.swatches;
var squareSize = 36; // 0.5 inch = 36 points
var padding = 6; // space between swatch and label
var textSize = 6;
var columns = 20;
var startX = 0;
var startY = 0;

var row = 0;
var col = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < swatches.length; i++) {
    var swatch = swatches[i];

    // Skip system swatches like [None], [Registration], etc.
    if (swatch.name.charAt(0) === '[') continue;

    var x = startX + col * (squareSize + padding);
    var y = startY - row * (squareSize + 2 * padding);

    // Draw the swatch square
    var rect = doc.pathItems.rectangle(y, x, squareSize, squareSize);
    rect.filled = true;
    rect.fillColor = swatch.color;
    rect.stroked = false;

    // Add the swatch name as a label below the square
    var label = doc.textFrames.add();
    label.contents = swatch.name;
    label.textRange.characterAttributes.size = textSize;
    label.textRange.characterAttributes.textFont = app.textFonts.getByName("MyriadPro-Regular");

    // Position label: baseline under the square
    label.left = x;
    label.top = y - squareSize - padding;

    // Next column
    col++;
    if (col >= columns) {
        col = 0;
        row++;
    }
}
